# No-To-Jeepney-Phaseout

A website written with three.js and containing 3D objects, created as part of protest against the plan of the Philippine government to phaseout jeepneys leaving tens of thousands with no livelihood and forcing jeepney drivers and operators to incorporate and take out loans with exorbitant rates to finance the new e-jeeps.  

This deal will surely tie public transportation to the real estate and shopping mall industries and the drivers and operators will be dependent on foreign companies for parts. 

Not to mention the massive corruption that's about to happen where the importers and dealerships will surely collude with politicians to steal as much money from the transport sector as they can get away with. 

We vehemently oppose this plan and we believe that the way forward is to invest in mass transit infrastructure like subway trains, trams, rapid bus transit, river ferry systems and bike sharing. The recent moratorium on the phaseout is not enough there must be a people-centric modernization in the transportation sector!
